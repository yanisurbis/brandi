- binding scopes https://brandi.js.org/reference/binding-scopes I don't understand what is the resolution chain
- dependency modules https://brandi.js.org/reference/dependency-modules not sure I got the difference fully
- why would we need to bind factories? https://brandi.js.org/reference/binding-types#tofactorycreator-initializer
- first example of binding factories is that we just bind a factory without any dependencies
